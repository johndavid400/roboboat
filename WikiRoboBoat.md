# Introduction #

This wiki acompanies the Chapter 9 of the APRESS Book "Arduino Robotics", which focusses on the construction of a GPS guided catamaran model boat. Actually, in download section you can find the source of the firmware, that runs on a modified ArduPilot Hardware. Yo can also find there a PDF file with the cross-section drawings that are used to build the floats of the catamarane.
